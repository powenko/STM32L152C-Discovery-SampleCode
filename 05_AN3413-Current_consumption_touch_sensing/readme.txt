@par Hardware and Software environment

  - Software environemnt
  ----------------------
    This Demo has been developed and tested with

     - EWARM v7.30
     - MDK-ARM v5.12
     - TrueSTUDIO v5.1.1 (Due to the limitation in debugging enviroment 
                           this example cannot be run in DEBUG mode)


  - ST-LINK/V2 driver requirement
  ------------------------------
    - After installing the toolset, the ST-LINK/V2 USB driver should by installed 
      automatically. 
    - In case of trouble you may find and download the latest driver from www.st.com/mcu 
      and install it.
        
  - Hardware environemnt
  ----------------------
     - Check jumper position on the board, JP1 on, CN3 on (Discovery selected).
     - Connect the Discovery board to a PC with a USB cable to power the board.

@par Example Description 

This software demonstration aims to use various peripherals and connectors on
Discovery  board.

When powering on the Discovery board, the Red LED LD2 (PWR) then lights up.
Function 1 (see table below) is executed, and each click on user button B1 changes 
the executed function.
